# IMPORTANT NOTES

- GitHub looks for a directory named `.github/workflows` to run any workflows. It has been renamed `dot-github/workflows` to prevent GitHub from actually attempting to run these examples. Make sure to name the workflow directory correctly for real projects.
- This directory only contains fragments of an actual project based on a Vue application.
